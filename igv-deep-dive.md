## Executive Summary

IGV is a concentrated, pure-play software ETF that has delivered strong long-term returns (16.3% annualised over 10 years) but is currently in severe drawdown — trading at $81.78, down 30.6% from its September 2025 all-time high of $117.79 and down 22.6% YTD in 2026. The fund carries an aggregate P/E of 29.04, 117 holdings, and a 0.39% expense ratio. Its top 10 holdings account for 59.7% of assets, making it a high-conviction vehicle with substantial single-stock risk.

The 2026 selloff — driven by hedge funds shorting software on fears that AI disrupts rather than enriches incumbents — has created a 25+ percentage point performance gap vs QQQ YTD, the widest divergence in the fund's modern history.

**The honest question: is this a buying opportunity or a value trap?**

Being at a low point and being undervalued are not the same thing. The data is genuinely mixed — and this deep dive doesn't pretend otherwise.

**Key findings:**

- **The 5-year Sharpe ratio is negative (-0.11):** IGV has destroyed risk-adjusted value over medium-term horizons. This is not just a dip — it's a pattern of underperformance punctuated by brief surges.
- **100% QQQ beats every IGV blend:** Over 10 years, on total return, max drawdown, AND Sharpe ratio. There is no allocation to IGV that improves a QQQ portfolio. The data is unambiguous.
- **The expected rate-cut tailwind never arrived:** IGV returned -3.7% during the cutting cycle while QQQ gained +30.7%. The catalyst that should have helped software instead got cannibalised by AI infrastructure.
- **AI monetisation is real but unevenly distributed:** ~30–40% of holdings have demonstrable AI revenue (MSFT, PLTR, NOW), but ~60–70% is either narrative or not AI-relevant at all.
- **Institutional money is leaving, not buying:** Fund flows -$2.03B trailing 12 months. Hedge funds are $24B short software. The smart money is betting against this trade.
- **The contrarian case exists but requires conviction:** -30.6% from ATH, near 52-week low, P/E at 29x (below QQQ's 32x). If the software rotation thesis is right, the entry is attractive. If it's wrong, there's no floor.

## What Is IGV?

The **iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)** is a passively managed exchange-traded fund launched by BlackRock that tracks the **S&P North American Expanded Technology Software Index**. It provides concentrated exposure to North American software companies across application software, systems software, and related sub-sectors.

### Fund Basics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Full Name | iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF |
| Ticker | IGV |
| Index | S&P North American Expanded Technology Software |
| Issuer | BlackRock (iShares) |
| AUM | ~$6.1B |
| Expense Ratio | 0.39% |
| Holdings | 117 |
| Aggregate P/E | 29.04x |
| 52-Week Range | $76.68 – $117.99 |
| Current Price | $81.78 (as of Feb 2026) |
| Fund Flows (12m) | -$2.03B |

### How the Index Works

The S&P North American Expanded Technology Software Index applies an **8.5% individual position cap**, with weight capping applied quarterly (starting March) and full index reconstitution semi-annually in June and December. Without the cap, Microsoft would likely command 15–20%+ given its ~$3.65T market cap. The cap mechanically forces quarterly redistributions from mega-caps into mid- and small-cap software names, creating a mild equal-weight tilt relative to pure market-cap weighting.

MSFT currently sits at 9.49% — above the stated 8.5% cap — because the cap is applied at rebalancing dates and positions drift between quarters through price appreciation.

### Is It "Pure Software"?

IGV is approximately 95.8% Information Technology and 3.6% Communication Services. However, a meaningful portion leaks beyond pure application and systems software:

- **EDA / Design Automation** (Synopsys, Cadence): ~6.9% — semiconductor design tools, adjacent to but distinct from enterprise software
- **Interactive Entertainment** (EA, Take-Two): ~3.3% — gaming, not enterprise/SaaS
- **Interactive Media** (Snap): ~0.2%
- **Crypto/Bitcoin miners & treasury** (MicroStrategy, Core Scientific, Hut 8): ~2.7%

Total "non-pure-software" exposure is approximately **13.1%**, making the fund roughly **87% pure software**. The crypto exposure via MicroStrategy and bitcoin miners is a particularly notable drift from the stated mandate, creating unintended volatility correlation with bitcoin prices.

## Historical Performance & Drawdown Analysis

### Calendar Year Returns (2015–2026)

| Year | IGV | QQQ | SPY | IGV Max DD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2015 | +12.5% | +8.7% | -0.8% | -13.0% |
| 2016 | +4.9% | +5.9% | +9.6% | -19.4% |
| 2017 | +42.0% | +31.5% | +19.4% | -6.2% |
| 2018 | +12.3% | -1.0% | -6.3% | -22.5% |

| 2021 | +12.3% | +26.8% | +27.0% | -15.3% |
| 2022 | **-35.7%** | -33.1% | -19.5% | **-39.2%** |
| 2023 | +58.5% | +53.8% | +24.3% | -10.3% |
| 2024 | +23.4% | +24.8% | +23.3% | -12.5% |

| 2026 YTD | **-22.6%** | -1.8% | +0.4% | -25.0% |

### Annualised Returns

| Period | IGV | QQQ | SPY |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-Year | -22.8% | +11.9% | +11.7% |
| 3-Year | +13.6% | +27.1% | +19.7% |
| 5-Year | +1.5% | +12.8% | +11.9% |
| 10-Year | +16.3% | +19.5% | +13.6% |

### The 2022 Drawdown — A Case Study

IGV peaked at **$89.30 on 9 November 2021** and troughed at **$48.35 on 4 November 2022** — a peak-to-trough drawdown of **-45.9%**, nearly double the S&P 500's drawdown. The decline lasted almost exactly 12 months and was driven by dual forces:

1. **Rate sensitivity:** High-multiple, long-duration software earnings were mechanically re-priced as the Fed hiked from 0% to 4.5%
2. **Fundamental deceleration:** Post-COVID pull-forward demand normalised, with many SaaS companies missing growth estimates

Recovery to the pre-2022 peak took **690 days** (until 24 September 2024) — nearly two years.

### Volatility Profile

| Metric | IGV (3yr) | IGV (5yr) | QQQ (3yr) | SPY (3yr) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Annualised Volatility | 23.7% | 27.2% | 19.6% | 15.2% |
| Beta vs S&P 500 | 1.28 | 1.33 | — | — |
| Sharpe Ratio | 0.39 | -0.11 | 1.16 | 1.01 |

IGV runs roughly 1.3x the beta of the S&P 500 with materially higher volatility. The 5-year Sharpe ratio is **negative** (-0.11), meaning IGV has destroyed risk-adjusted value over that period — driven by the 2022 crash and the 2026 selloff.

## IGV vs QQQ: Head-to-Head

### Structural Comparison

| Metric | IGV | QQQ |
|---|---|---|
| Expense Ratio | 0.39% | 0.20% |
| Total Holdings | 117 | ~100 |
| Top 10 Concentration | 59.7% | ~53% |
| Aggregate P/E | 29.04 | 32.44 |
| Sector | 96% IT + 4% Comms | ~60% IT + diversified |
| AUM | ~$6.1B | ~$413B |

IGV charges nearly double QQQ's fee and offers narrower sector exposure. QQQ includes hardware (Apple, Broadcom, NVIDIA), consumer (Amazon, Costco, Tesla), and telecom that IGV entirely excludes.

### When Does IGV Outperform QQQ?

IGV outperforms in **software-specific bull markets** where growth multiples expand:
- 2017: +42% vs +31.5%
- 2020: +51.9% vs +47.6%
- 2023: +58.5% vs +53.8%

It underperforms when the market favours hardware/semiconductors (2021, 2025, 2026) or during rate-driven selloffs where its higher duration premium amplifies losses. The 2025–2026 divergence is extreme: IGV returned just +5.6% in 2025 and -22.6% YTD in 2026, while QQQ posted +20.2% and -1.8% — a cumulative **~37 percentage point gap** driven by the AI trade rotating from software to infrastructure/hardware.

### Correlation Analysis

| Year | IGV–QQQ Correlation |
|---|---|
| 2017 | 0.798 |
| 2020 | 0.941 |
| 2022 | 0.933 |
| 2024 | 0.811 |
| 2026 | 0.865 |

The correlation ranges from 0.80 to 0.94, meaning IGV provides **limited diversification** relative to QQQ. It is functionally a higher-beta, sector-concentrated version of QQQ's tech exposure.

### Portfolio Blending Analysis (10 Years)

| Portfolio | Total Return | Ann. Return | Max Drawdown | Volatility | Sharpe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100% QQQ | +493.8% | 19.5% | -35.6% | 22.2% | 0.68 |
| 100% IGV | +352.3% | 16.3% | -45.9% | 25.7% | 0.46 |
| 70/30 QQQ/IGV | +454.5% | 18.7% | -38.3% | 22.7% | 0.63 |
| 50/50 QQQ/IGV | +426.4% | 18.1% | -40.2% | 23.4% | 0.58 |

**Blending IGV into QQQ does not improve risk-adjusted returns.** Every blend reduces total return, increases max drawdown, and lowers the Sharpe ratio vs 100% QQQ. The high correlation (~0.87) means the blend adds noise rather than diversification. **IGV only makes sense as a standalone conviction bet on software outperformance, not as a portfolio construction tool alongside QQQ.**

## AI Software Monetisation Thesis

### Leaders Within IGV

**Microsoft (9.5% weight):** Copilot has surpassed **150 million monthly active users** and **20 million GitHub Copilot users**. AI revenue run-rate was disclosed at approximately **$13 billion** in FY25 Q2, though the company has stopped breaking out Copilot-specific revenue. Commercial bookings more than doubled, with backlog reaching $392 billion.

**Palantir (8.2% weight):** Revenue growth accelerated throughout 2025 — 39%, 48%, 63%, 70% quarter-over-quarter — with FY2025 revenue growing 56% YoY and net income surging 250%+. US commercial revenue grew 137% in Q4 2025, customer base expanded from under 20 US commercial customers five years ago to over 500 today. FY2026 revenue guidance implies 61% growth.

**ServiceNow (3.8% weight):** The clearest enterprise AI monetisation story. Q3 2025 subscription revenue of **$3.3 billion** (+21.5% YoY) with **1,700 customers live on Now Assist**. AI products projected to exceed **$500 million in ACV** in 2025, targeting **$1 billion ACV by 2026**. 2026 subscription sales guided to **$15.5 billion minimum**.

**Salesforce (7.3% weight):** Agentforce is still in the **adoption phase with limited revenue generation to date**. Focused on driving engagement before layering in pricing — this is narrative, not yet revenue.

### Is the "Value Migration" Thesis Supported?

Partially. A reasonable estimate is that **30–40% of IGV's portfolio weight** (MSFT, PLTR, ORCL, CRM, NOW, CRWD, DDOG) has demonstrable AI revenue traction, while another **25–30%** has AI features without quantified revenue, and the remaining **30–40%** is either pre-revenue on AI or not AI-relevant at all.

The "value migration from hardware infrastructure to software layers" thesis has supporting evidence from ServiceNow and Palantir, but it is not yet a broad-based phenomenon across IGV's full portfolio.

## Valuation & Risk Assessment

### Valuation Distribution

IGV's aggregate P/E of 29.04 appears optically reasonable until you examine the distribution:

| Company | P/E Range | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| Palantir (PLTR) | >200x | Extreme — single biggest valuation risk |
| CrowdStrike (CRWD) | 60–70x | Elevated growth premium |
| ServiceNow (NOW) | 55–65x | Elevated but supported by AI revenue |
| AppLovin (APP) | Premium growth | Rapidly expanding, AdTech |
| Microsoft (MSFT) | ~32x | Anchor — drags average down |
| Oracle (ORCL) | ~25x | Value-range for software mega-cap |

The aggregate P/E is misleading because Microsoft and Oracle's relatively modest valuations mask the extreme multiples in PLTR, APP, CRWD, and NOW.

### Interest Rate Sensitivity

IGV is acutely rate-sensitive. During the hiking cycle (Jan 2022 – Jul 2023), IGV returned **-7.3%** vs SPY's -4.2%. But the cutting cycle (Sep 2024 – present) has been *worse*: IGV returned **-3.7%** while QQQ gained +30.7%. Rate cuts should have been tailwinds for long-duration software, but the AI infrastructure trade (semiconductors, hyperscalers) has cannibalised the capital flows that historically benefited software.

### Concentration Risk Scenario

If the top 3 holdings (MSFT, PLTR, ORCL = 25.63%) de-rate simultaneously:

- **20% de-rating** → ~5.1% portfolio loss
- **30% de-rating** → ~7.7% portfolio loss
- **40% de-rating** → ~10.3% portfolio loss

Given PLTR's extreme valuation, this is a base case risk, not a tail scenario. PLTR alone at 8.19% with a P/E above 200x could experience a 40–50% correction on any earnings miss, contributing 3–4% of portfolio-level drawdown from a single stock.

### Current Distress

- Trading at $81.78, near its 52-week low of $76.68
- Fund flows negative at **-$2.03 billion** trailing 12 months
- Hedge funds reportedly made **$24 billion shorting software stocks** in early 2026, with bets still increasing
- Down 22.6% YTD vs QQQ -1.8% — a 20+ percentage point divergence

## What IGV Does Well, What It Doesn't, and When It's Worth Owning

### What It Does Well

- Provides **concentrated, pure-play exposure** to the North American software stack — no better single vehicle for expressing a software-sector conviction
- The 8.5% cap prevents mega-cap domination, creating forced rebalancing that mechanically buys laggards and sells winners
- Houses several of the most important AI enterprise software franchises (MSFT, NOW, CRM, PLTR)
- P/E at 29x is optically cheaper than QQQ's 32x — though the bimodal distribution (PLTR >200x, ORCL ~25x) makes this misleading

### What The Data Says Against It

- **5-year Sharpe ratio is negative (-0.11)** — this is not a temporary dip. IGV has been a poor use of risk capital over any medium-term window that includes 2022 or 2026.
- **100% QQQ beats every IGV blend over 10 years** — on total return, max drawdown, AND Sharpe. There is no blend that improves things. If you could only own one, the answer is always QQQ.
- **The rate-cut catalyst failed** — software returned -3.7% during the cutting cycle while QQQ gained +30.7%. The expected tailwind got cannibalised by AI infrastructure flows.
- **Institutional money is leaving** — fund flows -$2.03B, hedge funds $24B short, momentum firmly against
- **Sector leakage** into EDA, gaming, crypto mining (~13%) dilutes the pure software thesis
- **The 2022 recovery took 690 days** — if this drawdown follows the same pattern, breakeven could be late 2027 or 2028

### The Honest Verdict

IGV at -30.6% from ATH is at a low point. That is a fact. Whether it's *undervalued* is a different question — and one the data does not clearly answer.

**The case for buying:** You are making a specific, time-bound bet that the software selloff is overdone, that AI will enrich software incumbents rather than displace them, and that capital will rotate back from infrastructure to application layers within 2–3 years. If you're right, the entry is attractive. The 29x P/E is below QQQ's 32x. After the 2022 crash (-35.7%), IGV bounced +58.5% in 2023 — there is precedent for violent recoveries.

**The case against:** The data overwhelmingly says QQQ is the better vehicle. The negative 5-year Sharpe isn't noise — it reflects a structural pattern where IGV underperforms in most environments and only surges in brief software-specific bull markets (2017, 2020, 2023). The rate-cut tailwind already failed. Institutional money is exiting. And the hedge fund short thesis — that AI *disrupts* software rather than enriching it — could be right.

**This is a timing bet, not a structural allocation.** If you take this position, own it for what it is: a contrarian call with asymmetric upside if right, but with the weight of the 10-year data against you.

## How This Fits My Portfolio

### Semiconductor Overlap — The Key Finding

**Zero semiconductor overlap.** A direct comparison of IGV's holdings against both SMH and SOXL reveals **0 overlapping holdings**. Synopsys (~3.3%) and Cadence (~3.3%) are EDA companies — they sell *software tools* to design chips, but they don't manufacture or sell semiconductors. Under GICS, both sit within Application Software. Adding IGV to ASML/SOXL positions will not double hardware exposure.

While IGV has 0.85–0.94 correlation with QQQ (limited diversification vs broad tech), it has only **0.74 correlation with SOXX** — and this is the number that matters for a semiconductor-heavy portfolio.

### IGV vs Semiconductors — Calendar Year Divergence

| Year | IGV | SOXX | Spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2021 | +12.2% | +44.1% | -31.9pp |
| 2022 | -35.6% | -35.1% | -0.5pp |
| 2023 | +58.5% | +67.1% | -8.6pp |
| 2024 | +23.4% | +12.9% | **+10.5pp** |
| 2025 | +5.6% | +40.7% | -35.1pp |

In 2024, software outperformed semiconductors by 10.5pp — the kind of diversification benefit that matters when hardware cycles peak. SOXL is 3x leveraged: in 2022, SOXX fell -35% while SOXL fell **-85.66%** due to leverage decay. IGV's -35.57% drawdown was dramatically better than SOXL.

### Overlap Matrix

| My Position | Overlap with IGV | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| ASML (Lithography) | **0%** — not held in IGV | Clean diversification |
| SOXL (3x Semiconductors) | **0%** — zero shared holdings | Clean diversification |
| BTC (Pot 5) | **~2.7% indirect** — MicroStrategy/miners in IGV | Minor, unintended |

### Five-Pot Framework Fit

This sits in the **self-managed pot (Pot 4):**

- **Clear thesis:** Software as the monetisation layer for AI infrastructure — zero semiconductor overlap provides structural diversification against ASML/SOXL
- **Consciously owned risk:** Severe drawdown (-30.6%), negative 5yr Sharpe, Palantir concentration, rate sensitivity, institutional exodus — all pre-accepted
- **Timing bet explicitly acknowledged:** The 10-year data says QQQ is strictly better. IGV earns its place only if the software rotation thesis plays out within 2–3 years. If it doesn't, this position will have been a drag on returns — and the data says that's the more likely outcome.

> The diversification argument is real: zero semiconductor overlap, 0.74 correlation with SOXX. For a portfolio concentrated in ASML + SOXL, IGV is the cleanest software exposure available. But be clear-eyed: you are betting against the 10-year data, against institutional flows, and against the hedge fund consensus. The entry price is attractive. Whether that's enough is a conviction call, not a data-driven one.
