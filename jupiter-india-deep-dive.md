## Executive Summary

Jupiter India Class X (Acc) is an actively managed India equity fund run by Avinash Vazirani since its 2008 inception — one of the longest single-manager tenures in the India fund space. The fund holds 91 stocks with a pronounced small/mid-cap bias and a growth-at-reasonable-price (GARP) discipline that has delivered consistent alpha: +5% annualised versus MSCI India over five years, ranking first quartile in three consecutive calendar years (2022–2024). The portfolio trades at 16.7x P/E versus the MSCI India benchmark's 20.0x, reflecting genuine valuation discipline rather than index-hugging.

**Key findings:**

- **The alpha is real but manager-dependent:** Vazirani's 18-year tenure and 8+ year average holding period have generated [143% cumulative return over 5 years versus MSCI India's 93%](http://factsheets.financialexpress.net/ZIL/NLT3_ROW.PDF) — but Morningstar flags key-man risk as the fund's most critical vulnerability. If Vazirani departs, the track record leaves with him.
- **India's valuations are stretched:** MSCI India trades at 20x forward P/E — a [64% premium to the MSCI Emerging Markets average](https://www.niftytrader.in/markets/indias-valuation-gap-narrows-but-remains-costly-vs-em-averages/) of 12.18x. This is expensive by any historical standard, though Jupiter India's own portfolio at 16.7x provides a valuation cushion.
- **The macro tailwinds are genuine but priced in:** [7.4% GDP growth forecast for FY26](https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-gdp-growth-forecast-fy-2025-26-41786.html/), demographics peaking in 2041, digital payments adoption at 83% — but consensus already expects 15% EPS growth. Anything less triggers derating.
- **Ashoka India Equity Investment Trust is the fee arbitrage opportunity:** At [0.20% OCF versus Jupiter's 0.70%](https://www.theaic.co.uk/companydata/ashoka-india-equity), with 14.9% annualised returns over 5 years, Ashoka is the superior vehicle for new money. Jupiter justifies its fee only if Vazirani's alpha persists.
- **Currency is a persistent headwind:** INR depreciated ~5% in 2025 and is forecast to weaken [1–2% annually versus GBP](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/usd-inr-price-annual-forecast-indian-rupee-could-disappoint-both-optimists-and-pessimists-alike-in-2026-202512220812). This is a structural drag, not a temporary dislocation.
- **The -6.6% drawdown from cost is noise, not signal:** India's 2025 underperformance reflects FII rotation to China and US tariff fears — technical factors, not structural deterioration.

**Verdict: HOLD. Jupiter India earns its place as a conviction EM bet, but diversify future India additions via Ashoka AIE for fee efficiency. Never exceed 10% of total portfolio.**

### The Vazirani Premium

Vazirani has 30+ years investing in Indian equities, dating to 1995 when he launched the Peninsular South Asia Access Fund. His pedigree includes CIO for South Asia and Africa at BNP Paribas and CEO of GEM Dolphin Investment Managers. [Colin Croft joined as co-manager in 2021](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00B4TZHH95-jupiter-india-fund-i-class-acc/key-statistics), though Vazirani remains the clear lead.

This longevity cuts both ways. The 8+ year average holding period and disciplined GARP approach have generated [top-quartile performance across multiple market cycles](https://www.trustnet.com/news/13453029/the-best-funds-in-the-worst-performing-sectors-who-held-firm-in-a-falling-indian-market). Over five years to December 2024, Jupiter India returned 143% versus MSCI India's 93% — a cumulative 50 percentage point advantage.

On the other hand, [Morningstar flags key-man risk](https://lt.morningstar.com/1c6qh1t6k9/snapshotresearchpdf/default.aspx?LanguageId=en-GB&SecurityToken=F00000MWK9) as a critical concern, noting that the strategy's high reliance on Vazirani creates succession vulnerability. The fund's off-benchmark exposure routinely exceeds 50%, amplifying both alpha potential and manager-specific risk. Should Vazirani depart, there is no deep bench to absorb the transition.

### Top 10 Holdings

| Rank | Holding | Weight | Sector |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Godfrey Phillips India | 7.69% | Consumer Staples (Tobacco) |
| 2 | Fortis Healthcare | 4.96% | Healthcare |
| 3 | State Bank of India | 4.59% | Financials |
| 4 | Bharat Petroleum | 4.29% | Energy |
| 5 | Bharti Airtel | 4.07% | Telecommunications |
| 6 | Larsen & Toubro (adjacent) | ~3.5% | Industrials |
| 7 | HCL Technologies | 2.88% | IT Services |
| 8 | HDFC Bank | 2.58% | Financials |
| 9–10 | Various | ~8% | Mixed |

Source: [FT Markets](https://markets.ft.com/data/etfs/tearsheet/holdings?s=GB00B4TZHH95%3AGBP), [HL Factsheet](https://www.hl.co.uk/funds/fund-discounts,-prices--and--factsheets/search-results/j/jupiter-india-class-x-accumulation)

Sector allocation favours financials (19.7%), energy (13.1%), and consumer staples (13.3%), with underweights in technology (4.5% vs 12% benchmark) and consumer discretionary (8% vs 15% benchmark). The largest single position — Godfrey Phillips India at 7.69% — exposes the fund to tobacco regulation risk, excise tax changes, and ESG exclusion.

The small/mid-cap bias enhances long-term growth capture but exacerbates downside volatility. During periods when small-caps underperform, Jupiter India suffers larger drawdowns than the market — a risk borne out in the fund's -14.6% maximum observed drawdown versus MSCI India's typical -10% to -12%.

### Performance: Consistent Alpha, Recent Pullback

Calendar year returns (Class I): +0.88% (2020), +35.47% (2021), +4.95% (2022), +31.12% (2023), +24.12% (2024). Source: [Morningstar](https://lt.morningstar.com/1c6qh1t6k9/snapshotpdf/default.aspx?LanguageId=en-GB&Id=F00000MWK9)

Through mid-2025, the fund posted [relative resilience during the Q4 2024/Q1 2025 FII selloff](https://www.jupiteram.com/uk/en/professional/insights/indian-stocks-recent-pullback-beckons-long-term-investors/) that saw $22 billion in outflows, falling less than the MSCI India benchmark.

### Fees

The Class X ongoing charge figure stands at 1.00%, but [Hargreaves Lansdown's loyalty bonus reduces the net cost to 0.70%](https://www.hl.co.uk/funds/fund-discounts,-prices--and--factsheets/search-results/j/jupiter-india-class-x-accumulation). No performance fee. At 0.70% net, the cost exceeds passive alternatives ([iShares MSCI India ETF at 0.61%](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239659/ishares-msci-india-etf)) but undercuts quality-focused active peers. The fee is justified only if the fund sustains its historical alpha — a task increasingly difficult as India's market efficiency improves.

## India Macro Thesis: Structural Tailwinds Meet Valuation Headwinds

### GDP Growth: Fastest Major Economy, But Moderating

India's economy is projected to expand [7.4% in FY 2025–26](https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-gdp-growth-forecast-fy-2025-26-41786.html/), comfortably ahead of China (4.8%), the US (1.9%), and the eurozone (~1.5%). This reflects:

- **Monetary stimulus:** The RBI cut rates by [125 basis points in 2025](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/interest-rate), bringing the repo rate to 5.25%
- **Fiscal measures:** GST rationalisation (~₹1.5 trillion in cuts), income tax relief, accelerated government capex
- **Base effects:** Q2 FY26 GDP surged 8.2%, the fastest quarterly growth in six quarters

Yet cracks are emerging. Private capex remains muted, inflation dropped to an anomalous 0.25% in October 2025 (signalling weak demand), and the [IMF revised its 2026 forecast down to 6.2%](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-gdp-growth-imf-revises-forecast-upwards-to-6-6-2026-outlook-revised-downwards-on-trump-tariff-impact/articleshow/124553623.cms) citing trade policy uncertainty.

For equity investors, mid-6% to low-7% growth represents a Goldilocks scenario — fast enough to drive earnings but not so hot as to trigger overheating. The risk lies in expectations priced for 8%+ perpetual growth, which history suggests is unsustainable.

### Demographics: The 40-Year Tailwind

India's demographic advantage is unparalleled. With a median age of 28 years, the working-age population (15–59) is projected to reach [59% by 2041](https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-exam/indias-demographic-dividend/) — the longest demographic dividend window of any major economy, extending from 2005 to 2055.

By 2030, [one in five working-age individuals globally will be Indian](https://www.ibef.org/research/case-study/the-talent-tsunami-harnessing-india-s-demographic-dividend-for-global-impact). The labour force could exceed 800 million. Female labour force participation — currently 24% versus a 47% global average — offers substantial upside if structural barriers are addressed.

However, demographics alone don't guarantee prosperity. [Only 20% of India's 600 million-strong labour force is skilled](https://www.ipsos.com/en-in/india-harnessing-its-demographic-dividend) versus 80% in developed markets. Youth unemployment reached 83% of total joblessness in 2024. Without aggressive reskilling, India risks a demographic disaster rather than dividend.

### Make in India: Ambitious Vision, Mixed Execution

Launched in 2014, Make in India aimed to raise manufacturing's share of GDP to 25% by 2022. A decade later, [manufacturing accounts for just 15.9% of GDP](https://theacademic.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/9.pdf) — down from 16.7% in FY 2013–14. The target of 100 million new manufacturing jobs remains aspirational.

Select wins include [Production-Linked Incentive schemes covering 14 sectors](https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-manufacturing-tracker-2025-33968.html/) attracting Apple, Samsung, and others. Export diversification into textiles, pharmaceuticals, and automotive components is capturing share as part of the "China+1" strategy.

But China produces [$20 trillion in manufacturing output annually](https://www.zetwerk.com/resources/knowledge-base/miscellaneous/rise-of-manufacturing-in-china-vis-a-vis-india/) (45% of global output) versus India's ~$2.8 trillion (3.3%). As one analyst put it: ["trying to take on the might of Chinese manufacturing is like trying to chop down a sequoia with a dessert spoon"](https://interactanalysis.com/insight/can-india-really-challenge-china-as-the-worlds-factory/).

**The lesson for equity investors:** India will not become the next China in manufacturing. The bull case never depended on out-manufacturing China — it rests on consumption-driven services growth powered by demographics, digitalisation, and productivity gains.

### Infrastructure Capex: The Growth Multiplier

India's infrastructure spending has [surged 800% over the past decade](https://www.eaaa.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/India_Infrastructure_Coming_of_Age.pdf), reaching ₹10 trillion (~$127 billion or 3.5% of GDP) in FY 2024:

- **Roads:** 33.8 km built per day on average; road capex expected to increase 1.8x over the next five years
- **Railways:** [₹2.65 lakh crore ($31.4 billion) allocated in Union Budget 2025–26](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2219991); electrification reached 99.1%
- **Airports:** [164 operational in 2025 versus 74 in 2014](https://www.ibef.org/industry/infrastructure-sector-india); plan to connect 120 new airports over the next decade

The RBI calculates infrastructure capex has a GDP multiplier of 2.45 in year one and 3.14 in year two. For investors, this translates into sustained demand for cement, steel, construction equipment, and engineering services — sectors Jupiter India accesses via industrial conglomerate holdings.

The risk is crowding out private capex. Despite government spending, [private sector investment remains subdued](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-outlook-2026-why-did-sensex-nifty-underperform-in-2025-where-are-indices-headed-next-year-top-things-to-know/articleshow/126273827.cms), with corporates preferring debt reduction over expansion.

### Digital Payments: Cashless Revolution Realised

India's Unified Payments Interface has reshaped the financial landscape. [UPI's share of digital payments soared from 34% in 2019 to 83% in 2024](https://ddnews.gov.in/en/upis-share-in-indias-digital-payments-surged-to-83-rbi-report/), with 21.63 billion transactions in December 2025 alone. Compound annual growth rate of 74% over five years, with [350 million active users and 340 million merchant QR codes](https://coinlaw.io/upi-statistics/).

For equity investors, digital payments underpin consumption tracking and provide operational leverage to banks, fintechs, and merchants. Jupiter India's holdings in HDFC Bank (2.58%) and Bharti Airtel (4.07%) position the fund to benefit.

### Rupee: Structural Weakness, Tactical Opportunities

The Indian rupee depreciated approximately [5% in 2025](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-in-2026-after-5-fall-in-2025-where-is-the-currency-headed-heres-what-sbi-says/articleshow/126319013.cms), hitting an all-time low near 91 per USD in early 2026. Drivers include $18 billion in FPI outflows, a [record trade deficit of $41.68 billion](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/usd-inr-price-annual-forecast-indian-rupee-could-disappoint-both-optimists-and-pessimists-alike-in-2026-202512220812) in October, and the RBI's pivot toward allowing market-driven pricing rather than fixed defence.

Forecasts for 2026 vary: [Bank of America sees 86 per USD](https://naga.com/en/news-and-analysis/articles/usd-to-inr-forecast) (5% appreciation), SBI sees 92 (2% depreciation). For GBP-based investors, expect **1.5–2.0% annual currency drag** on unhedged returns.

**Recommended approach:** Accept the unhedged exposure. Hedging costs roughly equal the expected drag, and Indian corporates in Jupiter India's portfolio (HCL Technologies, Bharti Airtel) earn significant revenues in hard currency, providing natural hedges.

### RBI Policy: End of the Easing Cycle

After cutting the repo rate by 125 basis points in 2025 to [5.25%](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/interest-rate), the RBI signalled a pause in December 2025. [Crisil expects inflation to rebound to 5.0% in FY 2026–27](https://economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-likely-to-keep-interest-rates-steady-as-inflation-edges-up-crisil-says/articleshow/126674889.cms), constraining further easing.

For equities, the end of the easing cycle removes a support pillar. Lower rates boosted valuations in 2025 by compressing discount rates; with policy rates now stable, earnings growth must do the heavy lifting to justify forward multiples.

---

## Risk Assessment: Valuation, Politics, and Concentration

### India's Valuation Premium: Expensive but Defended

India's equity market trades at a [forward P/E of 20.02x](https://www.niftytrader.in/markets/indias-valuation-gap-narrows-but-remains-costly-vs-em-averages/), nearly double the MSCI EM average of 12.18x — a 64% premium. In absolute terms, India now trades in line with the MSCI US Index (20.39x), a stark departure from historical norms.

**Bulls cite:** Superior 15% forward EPS growth (vs EM's 5%), higher 16% ROE (vs EM's 9%), lower 10-year max drawdown (-18% vs China's -30%). [Source: LinkedIn/Ashwat Raja Menon analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashwat-raja-menon_indiaequity-globalmarkets-stockmarket-activity-7386047436785549312-3KVh)

**Bears cite:** Decelerating growth, record 2025 FII outflows, earnings revision risk, and [China re-rating risk at 11x P/E](https://finimize.com/content/indias-expensive-stocks-hit-a-new-milestone-but-theres-a-cheaper-way-in) that could draw capital from India.

Jupiter India's portfolio P/E of 16.7x offers a valuation cushion versus the benchmark's 20x, reflecting genuine GARP discipline. A correction to 18x (10% downside) would bring India in line with its 10-year average and create a more compelling entry point.

### Coalition Politics: Reform Constraints

Modi's BJP [lost its single-party majority in June 2024](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/06/indias-shock-election-result-loss-modi-win-democracy), securing 240 seats versus the 272 needed to govern independently. The NDA coalition relies on Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U).

Implications: reform slowdown (land acquisition, labour law overhauls face higher hurdles), fiscal populism risk (coalition partners demand state spending), and [succession uncertainty](https://www.oxan.com/insights/prospects-for-india-in-2025/) for 2029. The coalition is stable for now — neither partner benefits from toppling the government — but fracture risk would trigger 5–10% corrections.

### Fund Concentration Risk

The 42.4% concentration in top 10 holdings sits in the middle of the active fund range — lower than Stewart Investors' 50% but higher than diversified ETFs' 10–12%. More concerning is single-manager risk. Vazirani's tenure provides continuity but creates a single point of failure. Morningstar's ["Average" People Pillar rating](https://lt.morningstar.com/1c6qh1t6k9/snapshotresearchpdf/default.aspx?LanguageId=en-GB&SecurityToken=F00000MWK9) reflects this vulnerability.

### China Competition: The Unwinnable Race

India will not out-manufacture China. China's [5x scale advantage](https://www.zetwerk.com/resources/knowledge-base/miscellaneous/rise-of-manufacturing-in-china-vis-a-vis-india/) — $20 trillion annually versus India's $2.8 trillion — is supported by infrastructure, supply chain depth, and ecosystem maturity that India cannot replicate in a decade.

India will capture niche "China+1" opportunities in labour-intensive sectors and [high-value segments where geopolitical diversification matters](https://www.heidrick.com/-/media/heidrickcom/publications-and-reports/positioning-india-on-the-global-manufacturing-stage.pdf). But India's competitive advantage remains in IT services, business process outsourcing, and digital infrastructure — sectors Jupiter India accesses via HCL Technologies (2.88%) and Bharti Airtel (4.07%).

## Vehicle Comparison: Active Alpha vs Passive Efficiency

### Head-to-Head

| Vehicle | OCF | 5yr Ann. Return | Alpha vs MSCI India | Liquidity | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Jupiter India X** | 0.70% | 10.71% | +5.0% pa | High (OEIC) | Active conviction; GARP discipline |
| **[Ashoka India AIE](https://www.theaic.co.uk/companydata/ashoka-india-equity)** | 0.20% | [14.9%](https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/a/ashoka-india-equity-inv-trust-ord-gbp0.01) | +10.5% pa | Medium (IT discount) | Fee arbitrage; small-cap growth |
| **[iShares INDA](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239659/ishares-msci-india-etf)** | 0.61% | [7.8%](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239659/ishares-msci-india-etf) | -1.9% pa | Very High | Passive beta; cost minimisation |
| **[Stewart Investors](https://www.stewartinvestors.com/ie/en/professional/our-strategies/our-funds/IE0001SRU3Q3.html)** | ~0.85% | -5.7% (1yr) | Negative (recent) | Medium | ESG-first investors |

### Jupiter India: The Active Conviction Play

The track record is the asset. 143% cumulative return over 5 years versus MSCI India's 93% is difficult to dismiss. Vazirani's GARP discipline — portfolio P/E of 16.7x versus benchmark 20x — provides genuine valuation cushion. The fund ranked first quartile in 2022, 2023, and 2024 consecutively.

The weakness is structural: key-man dependency. Morningstar is right to flag it. If Vazirani exits, exit the fund within 30 days.

### Ashoka India AIE: The Fee Arbitrage Play

At [0.20% OCF](https://www.theaic.co.uk/companydata/ashoka-india-equity) — 0.50% cheaper than Jupiter annually — Ashoka is the superior vehicle for new money on a fee-adjusted basis. The fund tracks MSCI India IMI (including small-caps), has delivered 14.9% annualised, and currently trades at [a -2.28% discount to NAV](https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/a/ashoka-india-equity-inv-trust-ord-gbp0.01) — buying at a discount provides an instant margin of safety.

The weakness is the investment trust structure: discounts can widen to -5% or -10% during market stress, creating temporary mark-to-market losses regardless of underlying performance.

### iShares INDA: The Passive Benchmark

The ETF works for cost-conscious investors seeking pure beta, but its [large-cap bias (73.9% in companies >$10B)](https://www.etfrc.com/INDA) misses India's small-cap growth stories. Cumulative tracking error of -1.88% over five years undercuts the cost argument. Academic research confirms that [actively managed EM funds outperform passive ETFs by 1.5–2.0% annually](https://econ.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Kremnitzer.pdf) net of fees — making INDA suboptimal for conviction allocations.

### Stewart Investors: The ESG Quality Play

Strong long-term track record but [recent underperformance (-5.7% in 2024)](https://www.stewartinvestors.com/ie/en/professional/our-strategies/our-funds/IE0001SRU3Q3.html) and higher fees (0.80–0.85%) make it a tertiary option. ESG constraints exclude sectors like tobacco and fossil fuels — potentially missing alpha sources Jupiter India captures (Godfrey Phillips India up 54% in 2024).

### Vehicle Verdict

**For existing positions:** Hold Jupiter India. Vazirani's alpha justifies the fee premium.

**For new money:** 50% Jupiter India / 50% Ashoka AIE. Blended OCF drops to 0.45%, diversifies manager risk, and captures small-cap exposure via Ashoka's IMI benchmark.

**Do not switch entirely:** The £11.50 annual fee saving on a £2,323 position is not worth abandoning an 18-year track record for a 6-year one.

## Bull / Base / Bear Scenarios

### Bull Case — 25% Probability

**Assumptions:** India GDP 8%+, INR stable to appreciating, MSCI India returns 18–20%, Jupiter alpha +5% pa

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Annual GBP Return | ~26.0% |
| 3yr Cumulative | +100% |
| IRR | 26.0% |
| Implied Value (from £2,323) | £4,652 |

**Narrative:** Coalition pushes through reforms, US-India trade deal signed, oil collapses to $60/barrel improving current account. Foreign investors reverse course, pouring $50B annually into Indian equities. MSCI India re-rates to 24x. Jupiter India captures small-cap winners in EVs and fintech. Rupee strengthens to 85 per USD.

**Requires everything going right.**

### Base Case — 60% Probability

**Assumptions:** India GDP 6.5–7.0%, INR depreciates 1.5% pa, MSCI India returns 10–12%, Jupiter alpha +3% pa

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Annual GBP Return | ~13.0% |
| 3yr Cumulative | +42.7% |
| IRR | 12.6% |
| Implied Value (from £2,323) | £3,315 |

**Narrative:** India maintains mid-6% growth, avoiding recession but missing 8%+ acceleration. Valuations stay elevated (20–22x P/E) as foreign investors rotate back. Jupiter India sustains alpha via GARP discipline but sees margin compression as peers crowd into small-caps. Rupee weakens modestly.

**Solid double-digit returns, in line with historical EM equity averages.**

### Bear Case — 15% Probability

**Assumptions:** India GDP 4.5–5.0%, INR depreciates 5% pa, MSCI India returns -5%, Jupiter alpha -2% pa

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Annual GBP Return | -10.5% |
| 3yr Cumulative | -30.3% |
| IRR | -11.3% |
| Implied Value (from £2,323) | £1,619 |

**Narrative:** US recession triggers global EM selloff. Foreign investors dump $100B of Indian equities, driving MSCI India from 20x to 15x. Coalition government fails to pass stimulus. Consumption collapses. Rupee crashes through 100 per USD. Small-caps in Jupiter India's portfolio suffer 40% drawdowns.

**Brutal correction, but survivable. Recovery likely by year 4 as structural drivers reassert.**

---

## Exit Triggers

1. **Manager Change:** Vazirani departs or moves to non-executive role → Sell 100% within 30 days. Track record is manager-specific.

2. **Sustained Underperformance:** 3-year rolling return < MSCI India -3% → Sell 50% immediately, remaining 50% on 6-month probation.

3. **Style Drift:** Portfolio turnover exceeds 50% annually (vs current ~15–20%); top 10 concentration drops below 30%; or P/E exceeds 25x → Reduce to 5% total portfolio.

4. **India Macro Deterioration:** GDP growth < 5% for two consecutive quarters; CAD > 3% of GDP; fiscal deficit > 7.5% of GDP; inflation > 8% for 6+ months → Trim to 5%.

5. **Valuation Extreme:** MSCI India P/E > 28x (> 130% premium to EM) → Sell 50%, redeploy to cheaper EM.

6. **Portfolio Rebalancing:** India position exceeds 12% of total household ISA → Trim to 10%.

---

## Conclusion

Jupiter India Class X earns its place as a conviction EM bet. Vazirani's 18-year track record, +5% annualised alpha, and genuine GARP discipline are rare in a space full of closet indexers. The -6.6% drawdown from cost reflects technical factors — FII rotation and tariff fears — not structural deterioration.

But the position carries real risks: key-man dependency, 20x benchmark valuations, and 1.5–2% annual currency drag. These are manageable but not dismissible.

**The optimal move: HOLD and hedge.**

- Retain Jupiter India for Vazirani's expertise
- Diversify future India additions via Ashoka AIE (0.20% vs 0.70% OCF, 14.9% annualised)
- Never exceed 10% total portfolio
- Set disciplined exit triggers to prevent emotional decision-making
