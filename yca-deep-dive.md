## Executive Summary

Yellow Cake PLC (YCA) is a Jersey-domiciled investment company that buys and holds physical uranium (U3O8) — it is essentially a marked-to-market uranium warehouse with minimal overhead and a long-term supply agreement with Kazatomprom, the world's largest uranium producer. It is **not** a data centre or AI equity. The link is second-order: AI/data center power demand -> more nuclear build-out -> structurally higher uranium prices -> higher NAV and share price for YCA.

**Key findings:**

- **Market cap ~GBP1.6B, holding ~21.7m lbs U3O8** (rising to >23m lbs after exercising the 2025 Kazatomprom purchase option at ~$75/lb)
- **Pro-forma NAV of 727p/share** at $101.25/lb uranium — the stock oscillates around small discounts/premiums to indicated NAV depending on spot and sentiment
- **1-year return +35-40%, 5-year cumulative return +200%** — strong performance driven by the structural uranium bull market
- **Primary supply deficit of ~15m lbs** (165m supply vs 180m demand) — underpinning the bull case
- **Enriched uranium prices at all-time highs:** ~$190/SWU vs ~$56 three years ago, driven by nuclear demand plus supply constraints
- **Analyst consensus: "Buy" to "Strong Buy"** with 12-month targets implying ~20-35% upside
- **Key risks:** Pure uranium price beta, Kazakh concentration, discount/premium-to-NAV swings, periodic dilutive equity issuance, and policy/incident tail risk

**The honest question: is this a compelling second-order AI infrastructure play, or an illiquid commodity proxy with geopolitical tail risk?**

The answer depends on your conviction in the nuclear renaissance thesis. The data centre power demand story is real and increasingly consensus — but YCA's payoff is entirely commodity-driven, and uranium has a history of long flat periods followed by violent spikes. Timing risk is substantial.

## What Is Yellow Cake?

Yellow Cake is a Jersey-domiciled investment company whose business model is to:

- Buy and hold physical U3O8 under a long-term offtake agreement with Kazatomprom
- Store uranium in Cameco/Orano facilities in Canada and France
- Provide listed, relatively pure exposure to the uranium spot price without mine development or operating risk

It has no operating business in the usual sense: revenue and earnings are dominated by fair-value movements in its uranium inventory rather than recurring cashflows.

> In practical terms, you are buying a marked-to-market uranium warehouse with minimal overhead and a Kazatomprom supply option.

### Fund Basics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Full Name | Yellow Cake PLC |
| Ticker | YCA (LSE) |
| Domicile | Jersey |
| Market Cap | ~GBP1.6B |
| Uranium Holdings | ~21.7m lbs U3O8 |
| Employees | 2 |
| Supply Agreement | Kazatomprom (long-term offtake) |
| Storage | Cameco/Orano facilities (Canada & France) |
| Revenue Model | Fair-value movements on uranium inventory |

### How the Business Works

YCA has a long-term framework agreement with Kazatomprom (world's largest uranium producer) to buy specified volumes at contracted discounts to spot or reference prices. YCA then stores the physical uranium in Western facilities and provides investors with a listed vehicle to gain uranium price exposure.

The company recently completed an upsized equity raise (~$175m) to fully exercise the 2025 purchase option at ~$75/lb. Post-completion holdings exceed 23m lbs U3O8. This periodic equity issuance is intrinsic to the model — issuing above NAV is accretive; below NAV is dilutive. Execution discipline matters.

### What YCA Is Not

YCA is **not**:
- A uranium miner (no exploration, permitting, development, or operational risk)
- A data centre or AI infrastructure company (no direct exposure to rents, SMR IP, or EPC upside)
- A diversified commodity fund (pure single-commodity exposure)
- A cash-generating business in the traditional sense (profit is unrealised inventory revaluation)

Relative to miners, YCA is closer to a listed commodity trust like Sprott Physical Uranium Trust or a precious metals ETF — providing clean commodity beta without operational risk.

## Scale, NAV and Performance

### Current Position

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Market Cap | ~GBP1.6B |
| Uranium Holdings | ~21.7m lbs U3O8 (rising to >23m lbs) |
| Recent NAV (Q3 2025) | GBP6.06/share at $82/lb spot |
| Pro-forma NAV (Jan 2026) | 727p/share at $101.25/lb |
| 1-Year Return | +35-40% |
| 5-Year Cumulative Return | +200% |
| Weekly Volatility | ~5% (in line with UK market averages) |

### NAV Dynamics

YCA's value is driven almost entirely by the uranium spot price and inventory volumes:

- **Q3 2025 example:** Uranium portfolio value increased from ~$1.70B to ~$1.78B as spot moved from ~$78.5 to $82/lb. NAV per share rose ~5% to GBP6.06.
- **Pro-forma Jan 2026:** At ~$101.25/lb, indicated NAV of 727p/share (~$2.41B total).
- The stock oscillates around small discounts/premiums to indicated NAV depending on spot price and market sentiment.

### Valuation Anchor

P/E is mostly meaningless for YCA — profit swings are dominated by unrealised gains/losses reflecting non-cash revaluations rather than an impaired business. **Price/NAV and discount/premium are the relevant metrics.**

### Analyst Consensus

- Multiple independent sources indicate a consensus **"Buy" to "Strong Buy"**
- 12-month price targets imply ~20-35% upside
- TradingView aggregates 6 analysts with a ~705p average target
- Investing.com and MarketBeat show consensus in the mid-600s GBX with 20-30% implied upside

### Market Technicals

- Medium volatility (~4-5% daily ranges at times; 4.8% typical weekly moves)
- Relatively stable vs many small-cap resources names
- Reasonable liquidity for a mid-cap, with daily value traded in the tens of millions of pounds on active days

From a portfolio perspective, YCA behaves like a geared play on uranium with occasional sentiment-driven over/under-shoot vs NAV.

## The AI / Data Centre Power Thesis

This is the core of the bull case — and the reason YCA appears on a portfolio radar at all. The link is indirect but structurally sound:

**AI/data center power demand -> more nuclear build-out -> structurally higher uranium prices -> higher NAV and share price for YCA**

### The Demand Side: Data Centres Need Power

Hyperscalers (AWS, Microsoft, Google, Meta) are signing nuclear PPAs and SMR deals to secure baseload for AI/data centers:

- **Goldman Sachs** estimates data center power demand could increase **>150-175% by 2030**
- Data centers are becoming one of the largest "countries" in power consumption terms
- This is driving incremental demand for nuclear build-out in developed markets, where reliability and decarbonisation matter for AI clusters
- Hyperscalers specifically need firm, carbon-light baseload — intermittent renewables alone cannot serve the always-on computational workloads of AI training and inference

### The Supply Side: Uranium Is Constrained

- **Enriched uranium prices at all-time highs:** ~$190/SWU vs ~$56 three years ago
- **Primary supply deficit:** ~165m lbs supply vs ~180m lbs demand — a structural shortfall
- **Nuclear capacity outlook:** World Nuclear Association projects capacity to roughly double by ~2040
- **Western enrichment/conversion bottlenecks** further tighten the market — decades of underinvestment in the nuclear fuel cycle are not quickly reversed

### YCA Management's Own View

Management explicitly cites "significant new demand from hyperscalers and the rapidly growing sector of data centres" as a driver reinforcing the uranium bull case and their decision to raise equity to buy more physical uranium.

### What You Are and Are Not Getting

This is critical to understand:

**You are getting:**
- Exposure to the commodity whose demand is being structurally underwritten by data centre growth
- Clean uranium price beta that flows directly into NAV

**You are not getting:**
- Direct exposure to data center rents, yield compression, or land appreciation
- SMR technology value capture (IP, licensing, EPC margins)
- The capex and EBITDA growth of nuclear OEMs, SMR developers, or grid-scale infra platforms

> YCA is a second-order data-centre/AI power trade: if that thesis is right, it tightens the already-constrained uranium market and supports higher prices, which flow quite cleanly into NAV.

### The Nuclear Renaissance in Context

The demand story is not just about data centres. Multiple structural tailwinds are converging:

- **Global reactor restarts and new builds:** China, India, Middle East, and some European reversals (notably France, UK, and even Germany reconsidering)
- **Energy security concerns:** Post-Ukraine, Western nations are reappraising nuclear as indigenous, reliable baseload
- **Decarbonisation mandates:** Nuclear is the only proven, scalable zero-carbon baseload technology
- **SMR development:** While still early-stage, the pipeline of small modular reactor projects is growing rapidly, with hyperscaler backing providing credible demand anchors

Data centres are the newest and most visible demand catalyst, but the uranium bull case does not depend solely on them.

## Business Model vs Miners and Other Vehicles

### The Physical Holder Model

YCA occupies a specific niche in the uranium investment landscape: pure physical exposure without mine risk.

**What you avoid with YCA:**
- Mine-level risks: capex blowouts, geology surprises, labour disputes, permitting delays, ESG incidents
- Project concentration risk vs single-asset junior miners
- Operational leverage that amplifies losses when uranium prices decline

**What you accept:**
- Pure uranium price beta (spot and term) — your entire return is driven by commodity price movements
- Liquidity and discount/premium-to-NAV swings based on market sentiment
- Counterparty/geopolitical exposure to Kazakh supply, albeit with inventory warehoused in Western facilities
- FX exposure: inventory is priced in USD while shares trade in GBP
- Periodic dilution from equity raises required to expand holdings

### Comparative Positioning

| Vehicle Type | Examples | Risk Profile | Upside Profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Physical holders** | YCA, Sprott Physical Uranium Trust | Clean commodity beta, no operational risk | Tracks spot price through NAV |
| **Major miners** | Cameco, Kazatomprom | Operating leverage + mine risk | Amplified upside on uranium price rises |
| **Junior miners** | Various exploration/development | Extreme project risk | Lottery-ticket upside if deposit proves out |
| **Uranium ETFs** | Global X Uranium ETF, Sprott Uranium Miners | Diversified miner exposure | Blended mining and exploration beta |
| **Nuclear utilities** | EDF, Exelon, Constellation | Regulated, diversified | Lower volatility, less direct uranium exposure |

YCA sits at the **"cleanest physical exposure, modest structural/geopolitical risk"** point on that spectrum. Compared to Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (the closest comparable), differences are mainly jurisdictional, structural, and liquidity-related — both provide fundamentally similar exposure.

### The Kazatomprom Relationship

The supply agreement with Kazatomprom is both the key enabler and a concentration risk:

- **Enables:** Contracted access to physical uranium at negotiated terms from the world's largest producer (~43% of global supply)
- **Risks:** Heavy dependence on a single supplier in Kazakhstan — sanctions, export restrictions, or political disruption could affect availability or pricing
- **Mitigant:** Physical inventory is already stored ex-Kazakhstan in Cameco/Orano facilities in Canada and France — the uranium is in Western hands regardless of future Kazakh policy changes

## Risk Assessment

### Macro / Commodity Risks

**Uranium price risk — the dominant factor:**
- If new supply (mine restarts, greenfield projects) comes online faster than expected, or demand growth disappoints (SMR delays, nuclear political pushback, cheaper alternative baseload), spot could correct sharply
- Historically, uranium has shown **long, flat periods followed by violent spikes** — the commodity traded sideways for over a decade after the 2007 peak before the current bull market. Timing risk is substantial.
- The current deficit (~15m lbs) is meaningful but not unprecedented — a handful of mine restarts or demand deferrals could close the gap

**Energy transition and policy risk:**
- A serious nuclear incident (another Fukushima-scale event) could stall reactor build-out and term contracting globally, particularly in Europe and Japan
- Political reversal or green backlash against nuclear in key markets
- Regulatory delays for SMRs could push out the "AI power" thesis timing by multiple years — SMR deployment timelines have already slipped repeatedly

### Company-Specific Risks

**Concentrated supplier exposure:**
- Heavy reliance on Kazatomprom and Kazakhstan
- Any sanctions, export restrictions, or political disruption could affect availability or pricing
- Mitigant: inventory already stored ex-Kazakhstan in Canada/France

**Capital raises and dilution:**
- Business model requires periodic equity issuance to expand holdings — this is structural, not exceptional
- Recent deals raised >$175m to fund new U3O8 purchases
- **Issuing above NAV is accretive; below NAV is dilutive.** In a bear market for uranium, the company may be unable to raise capital on attractive terms, limiting its ability to exploit lower prices

**Discount/premium volatility:**
- In euphoric phases, YCA can trade at a meaningful premium to NAV — you overpay for the uranium
- In risk-off environments, discounts can widen sharply, temporarily decoupling share performance from spot
- This creates a second layer of volatility on top of the underlying commodity

**Operational/structural:**
- Storage, insurance, and custody cost inflation
- FX risk between USD (commodity) and GBP (equity) — a strengthening pound reduces NAV in GBP terms even if uranium prices are flat

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Outcome | IRR | Key Driver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bull Case** | 40% | +20-35% | 15-20% | Uranium deficit widens, hyperscaler nuclear demand accelerates, spot pushes through $120+/lb |
| **Base Case** | 40% | Track NAV (+/-10%) | 5-10% | Uranium consolidates at current levels, steady demand growth, YCA tracks spot through NAV |
| **Bear Case** | 20% | -30% to -40% | -15% to -20% | Supply restarts, SMR delays, policy shock, or sentiment shift causes spot correction and NAV discount |

### Exit Triggers

Conditions that would invalidate the thesis:

- Uranium spot price declines >30% from peak without a supply-side catalyst
- Kazatomprom supply agreement terminated or materially altered
- Share trades at >15% discount to NAV for an extended period (>3 months)
- Major nuclear incident causing policy reversal in key markets
- Significant equity issuance below NAV (dilutive)
- SMR development delays push AI/data centre nuclear timeline beyond 2032

## Sizing, Alternatives, and the Honest Verdict

### Position Sizing Guidance

Because the underlying is a thin commodity market with geopolitical and policy tail risk, most institutional investors treat uranium vehicles as **low- to mid-single-digit % positions** rather than core holdings.

YCA is best viewed as a **satellite position** in a portfolio built around:
- Core AI/data center names (hyperscalers, DC REITs/operators)
- Core infra/utility exposures (regulated grids, nuclear utilities)
- Possibly one or two SMR developers if comfortable with tech/regulatory risk

### Alternative Vehicles

| Vehicle | Ticker | Structure | Key Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sprott Physical Uranium Trust | U.UN / SRUUF | Physical holder (Canadian-listed) | Closest comparable to YCA; different jurisdiction, liquidity profile |
| Cameco Corp | CCJ / CCO | Largest Western uranium miner | Operating leverage at cost of mine risk; diversified across mining + fuel services |
| Global X Uranium ETF | URA | Basket of uranium miners and physical holders | Diversified but includes junior miner risk; ~24% Cameco, ~8% Sprott, ~6% YCA |
| Sprott Uranium Miners ETF | URNM | Pure-play uranium miners + physical | Higher concentration in uranium space than URA |

### The Honest Verdict

**What YCA does well:**
- Transparent, scalable exposure to uranium with minimal operating risk
- A credible supply agreement that provides contracted access to physical material
- Clean commodity beta — no operational noise, no mine risk, no project delays
- 2 employees, low overhead, straightforward mandate

**What the data says against it:**
- **Entirely commodity-driven payoff** — if uranium prices go sideways, you earn nothing (no yield, no dividends, no operational value creation)
- **Timing risk is real** — uranium has a history of decade-long flat periods between violent bull markets
- **Periodic dilution** — the equity raise model is a structural feature, not a bug, but it means your per-share economics depend on management's capital allocation discipline
- **Counterparty concentration** in Kazatomprom/Kazakhstan
- **No direct participation** in the highest-value parts of the nuclear/AI value chain (SMR IP, EPC margins, data centre rents)

**Bottom line:** As an alternative holding leveraged to data-centre-driven power demand, YCA is a **logical, but indirect** expression of the thesis. The thematic link — AI/data centers -> nuclear growth -> uranium deficit — is real and increasingly recognised. But the payoff is entirely at the commodity layer, and the risks (price volatility, Kazakh concentration, policy shocks, NAV discount swings) are meaningful.

## How This Fits My Portfolio

### Five-Pot Framework Fit

This position belongs in the **self-managed pot (Pot 4)** — the conviction, learning, and personal agency allocation. Here is how it maps:

| Pot 4 Criteria | YCA Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Clear thesis** | Second-order AI power demand trade through nuclear/uranium structural deficit |
| **Unique exposure** | Not captured by index funds — concentrated commodity proxy with zero equity overlap |
| **Accepted risk** | Uranium volatility, Kazakh concentration, NAV swings are consciously owned |
| **Learning value** | Deep engagement with commodity markets, energy transition dynamics, nuclear fuel cycle, and geopolitical supply chains |

### Portfolio Overlap Analysis

This is where YCA is genuinely interesting from a portfolio construction perspective:

| Existing Position | Overlap with YCA | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Cash ISA (Pot 1) | **0%** | Completely uncorrelated — YCA drawdowns do not affect the stability anchor |
| Fixed/Passive S&S (Pot 2) | **Minimal** | Index funds have negligible uranium exposure; structurally different risk factor |
| Managed S&S (Pot 3) | **Minimal** | Wealthify unlikely to hold YCA; different decision-maker manages drawdowns |
| Self-Managed S&S (Pot 4) | **Complementary** | Provides commodity exposure against existing equity positions (ASML, SOXL, IGV, Jupiter India) |
| Crypto (Pot 5) | **0% direct** | Different asset class, different wrapper, different rules — but both are "alternative" allocations |

**The key insight:** YCA introduces a genuinely different risk factor into the self-managed pot. Existing Pot 4 holdings are equity-centric — semiconductor equipment (ASML), leveraged semiconductors (SOXL), software (IGV), and emerging market equities (Jupiter India). YCA is a commodity play driven by a fundamentally different set of supply/demand dynamics. Uranium prices are not correlated with semiconductor cycles or software multiples.

### Position Sizing Within the Self-Managed Pot

The self-managed pot targets 15% of total portfolio. Within that allocation, YCA should be sized as a **satellite position** — low single-digit % of total portfolio, not a core holding.

**Rationale:**
- The underlying commodity market is thin with geopolitical tail risk
- YCA generates no income — it is pure capital appreciation driven by spot price
- The timing of uranium price moves is inherently unpredictable
- As a second-order play on the AI infrastructure thesis, it should be sized below direct AI/data centre positions

### Behavioural Considerations

YCA tests the five-pot system in a specific way:

- **Uranium will have flat periods.** The current bull market is driven by structural deficit and nuclear renaissance sentiment, but uranium historically goes through extended consolidation phases. The system must tolerate holding a non-yielding commodity proxy through these periods without reallocating.
- **NAV discount/premium swings will feel irrational.** The stock can trade at a meaningful discount to underlying uranium value in risk-off environments. The system must treat this as a buying opportunity (via future contributions) rather than a signal to sell.
- **The thesis is long-duration.** Nuclear build-out operates on 5-15 year timelines. SMR deployment is still early. The data centre power demand story is playing out over years, not quarters. This position requires patience that the self-managed pot is designed to support.

### Rebalancing Rules (Consistent with Pot 4 Philosophy)

- **Rebalancing through contributions only** — no selling to rebalance. If YCA outperforms, let it run. If it underperforms, direct future contributions to rebuild the position.
- **No selling unless the thesis breaks** — a uranium price correction is not a thesis break. Thesis breaks are: Kazatomprom agreement collapse, major nuclear policy reversal, or structural demand thesis invalidation.
- **Drawdown response: hold** — Pot 4 rules apply. Losses are the cost of learning and participation, not a failure of the system.

> For a portfolio already long equities across semiconductors, software, and emerging markets, a modest YCA allocation adds convex upside to a structural nuclear/uranium bull case at the cost of higher cyclical and geopolitical risk. It diversifies the commodity exposure in Pot 4 and provides a genuinely uncorrelated return driver. But the position must be sized for what it is: a satellite holding in a thin commodity market, not a core allocation.
